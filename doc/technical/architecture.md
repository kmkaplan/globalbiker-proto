# Architecture

## Generator

This project was generated in August 2014 using [DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack).

This generator has not been very active then, but ultimately it is active again and the 3.0 release is in progress.

We should consider to upgrade once it is released.

## Client side: AngularJS application

The client side is an [angularJS](https://angularjs.org) v1.x application.

The angular app uses [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) and communicates with the backend using [JS-Data](http://js-data.io).

## Server side: NodeJS/MongoDB REST API

The server REST API is provided by [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) & [express](http://expressjs.com).

The data is persisted into MongoDB database using [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose).
